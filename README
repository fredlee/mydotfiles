Vim has been segfaulting, hanging, and crashing for me on Snow Leopard lately. 

Here is my setup:
* OS X 10.6.7
* RVM installed
* MacVim installed via Homebrew
* Vim 7.2 or 7.3 compiled by me.
* The Ruby interpretor is turned on.

After tons of yak shaving, I think I've figured out a process to make Vim 7.3 and
MacVim 7.3, with the Ruby interpreter turned on, and Command-T work. Test it
please.

RVM
===

1. Configure RVM to use the system Ruby from Snow Leopard.

    % rvm use system

MacVim
======

1. Remove previous installation of MacVim. If you have MacVim installed via 
Brew:

    % brew uninstall macvim

2. Install MacVim from a pre-compiled binary for Snow Leopard. Get it here.

    % http://github.com/downloads/b4winckler/macvim/MacVim-7_3-53.tbz

3. Install Command-T per instructions. Use the MacVim you just installed. Make 
sure that you are still using the system Ruby, not anything from RVM.

Vim 7.3
=======

1. Configure

    % ./configure --prefix=$HOME --enable-multibyte --enable-rubyinterp --enable-gui=no --disable-gpm

2. Make, and Install 

    % make test
    % make
    % make install
